I have created an GPT-4 AI-Article Summarizer Application.

Through this project, you'll not only develop the application but also acquire knowledge on various other aspects such as 
1. Setting up a ReactJS project using Vite, 
2. Designing a visually appealing and responsive UI/UX with a touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS, 
3. Creating advanced RTK query API requests that trigger based on certain conditions, 
4. Saving history using local storage, managing form events and error handling, implementing copy to clipboard feature, and writing organized code.
